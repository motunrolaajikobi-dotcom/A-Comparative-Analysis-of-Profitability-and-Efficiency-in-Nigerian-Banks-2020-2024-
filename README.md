### Description
This project provides opportunity to gain hands on experience in designing interactive dashboards using Excel. It analyzes the financial performance of selected banks over multiple years to understand profitability, efficiency, and income structure. The analysis focuses on key financial metrics such as operating profit, cost-to-income ratio, and interest income.

### Objective
- Comparing profitability across banks
-	Assess operational efficiency
-	Understand income structure and expense impact
-	Present insights using an interactive dashboard
### Processes
Steps taken to prepare the dataset:
#### Step 1
-	Removed duplicates and irrelevant columns
-	Standardized column names
-	Converted financial figures to consistent formats
#### Step 2
	Created calculated fields:
-   Profit Margin
-	Cost-to-Income Ratio
-	Average Interest Income
-	Average net interest income
#### Step 3
•	Used Power Query to merge and transform datasets
### Tools Used
-	Microsoft Excel
-	Power Query (data cleaning & transformation)
-	Pivot Tables
-	Slicers
-	Charts & Dashboard design

### Insights
#### Profitability Performance
-	GTBank is the most profitable bank in the data, recording the highest Profit Before Tax (PBT) of 9,975,392 and Profit After Tax (PAT) of 8,909,136.
-	The profit share donut chart shows GTBank contributes the largest proportion of total industry profit of 22%, indicating strong earnings dominance.
#### Operational Efficiency
-	GTBank demonstrates the best operational efficiency, supported by a favorable cost-to-income ratio of 4467.4%.
-	Banks with higher operating expenses, such as Access Bank and Zenith Bank, record lower profit margins, highlighting weaker cost efficiency.
#### Income Structure
-	Interest income is the primary driver of profitability, particularly for GTBank.
-	The Interest Income vs Net Interest Income scatter plot shows a strong positive relationship, confirming that banks with higher interest income generate higher net interest income.
#### Expense Impact on Profitability
-	The Operating Expenses vs PAT scatter plot reveals a negative relationship, indicating that rising expenses reduce profitability.
-	Banks that fail to control operating costs experience diminished profit outcomes, even when income levels are reasonable.
#### Scale vs Profitability
-	Larger asset size does not automatically translate into higher profitability.
-	Despite not having the largest total assets, GTBank outperforms peers in profitability due to efficient income generation and expense control.

### Recommendations
#### Improve Cost Management
-	Banks with lower profitability should focus on tightening operating expenses, particularly administrative and overhead costs.
-	Implementing process automation and digital banking solutions can help reduce long-term cost burdens.
#### Diversify Income Streams
-	Banks heavily dependent on interest income should expand non-interest income sources such as:
-	Transaction fees
-	Digital banking services
-	Advisory and investment services, This would reduce earnings volatility and improve income stability.
#### Enhance Operational Efficiency
-	Lower-performing banks can benchmark GTBank’s cost-to-income practices to improve efficiency.
-	Regular performance monitoring using efficiency ratios should be embedded in management decision-making.
#### Strategic Asset Utilization
-	Banks should focus on asset productivity rather than asset size, ensuring assets are deployed into high-yield, low-risk activities.
-	Improved credit risk management can enhance returns without significantly increasing costs.

### Limitations
- Limited Scope of Banks: The analysis covers only five Nigerian banks, which may not fully represent the entire banking sector.
- Absence of Macroeconomic Factors: External factors such as inflation, interest rate changes, and regulatory policies are not incorporated, yet they significantly influence bank performance.
- Aggregated Data: The use of aggregated yearly data may mask short-term fluctuations and seasonal performance variations.
- Ratio Interpretation Constraints:	Some ratios (e.g. profit margin, cost-to-income) may appear unusually high due to data scaling or unit inconsistencies, which could affect interpretability.
- No Risk Adjustment: The dashboard does not account for credit risk, non-performing loans, or capital adequacy, which are critical in assessing sustainable profitability.
